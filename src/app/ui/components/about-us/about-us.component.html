        <h2>Our Business Ethics</h2>
        
        <div class="subsection">
          <h5>A. Honesty</h5>
          <p>
            Our main principles in all of our commercial dealings and interpersonal interactions are honesty and integrity. 
            We conduct ourselves with honesty and integrity toward all of our stakeholders, including our employees.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div class="subsection">
          <h5>B. Privacy</h5>
          <p>
            Confidential and proprietary information comprises trade secrets, financial and other information that hasn't been made public yet, 
            information about personnel's personal rights, and information that falls under the purview of "confidentiality agreements" signed with third parties. 
            It also includes information that belongs to Tüm Group Companies that might put them at a competitive disadvantage. As staff members of Tüm Group, 
            we take precautions to safeguard the personal information of our clients, partners, and other pertinent parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is absolutely unacceptable for us to obtain any financial benefit by disclosing any private information owned by Tüm Group Companies, 
            including trading shares on stock markets. We do not take with us any confidential documents, projects, policies, or other information 
            that we are required to have because of our work when we leave our organization.

        </div>
  
        <div class="subsection">
          <h5>C. Conflict of Interest</h5>
          <p>
            We aim to avoid conflicts of interest as Tüm Group employees. Making the most of our current mission: We do not personally gain anything 
            from people or companies that we do business with, either directly or through family or relatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Tüm Group Companies, we do not engage in business activities based on additional financial interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use these techniques in the event of a possible conflict of interest when we think that morally and legally sound measures can safeguard 
            the interests of concerned parties. We seek advice from the Ethics Committee, the Human Resources Department, or our boss whenever we are doubtful.
